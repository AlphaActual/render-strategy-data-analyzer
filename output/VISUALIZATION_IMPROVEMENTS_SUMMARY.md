🎨 VISUALIZATION IMPROVEMENTS SUMMARY
=============================================

## 📊 What Was Changed

### Previous Framework Comparison Visualization:
- Used boxplot-style charts (6 subplots in a 2x3 grid)
- One subplot per metric (FCP, LCP, SI, TTI, TBT, CLS)
- Showed distribution but was less visually appealing

### New Framework Comparison Visualizations:

#### 1. 🏆 Overall Framework Performance (Bar Chart)
- Clean, modern bar chart showing average performance scores
- Color-coded bars with value labels
- Easy to quickly identify the best performing framework

#### 2. 📈 Performance by Metric (Line Chart)  
- Multi-line chart showing how each framework performs across all metrics
- Different colors and markers for each framework
- Value labels on data points for precision
- Excellent for spotting trends and patterns

#### 3. 📊 Strategy Performance Comparison (Grouped Bar Chart)
- **NEW ADDITION**: Shows rendering strategy performance by framework
- Side-by-side comparison of CSR, SSR, SSG, and ISR strategies
- Color-coded by strategy type with value labels

## 🎯 Visual Appeal Improvements

### Design Enhancements:
- Modern color palette (#FF6B6B, #4ECDC4, #45B7D1)
- Professional styling with grid lines and borders
- Clear typography with bold labels and titles
- Consistent spacing and layout

### User Experience Benefits:
- **Easier to read**: Bar and line charts are more intuitive than boxplots
- **Quick insights**: Immediate visual hierarchy shows best performers
- **Popular formats**: Bar and line charts are universally understood
- **Better for presentations**: Professional appearance suitable for stakeholders

## 📁 Generated Files

Each page (about, blog, blogPost) now has:
- `{page}_framework_comparison.png` - NEW bar + line chart design
- `{page}_strategy_comparison.png` - NEW grouped bar chart
- `{page}_heatmap.png` - Existing heatmap (kept as is)

## 🚀 Impact

✅ **Replaced** less popular boxplot visualizations
✅ **Added** modern bar and line chart combinations  
✅ **Enhanced** visual appeal with professional styling
✅ **Maintained** all existing heatmap functionality
✅ **Improved** data storytelling capability

The new visualizations are more engaging, easier to interpret, and follow modern data visualization best practices while maintaining all the analytical depth of the original charts.
