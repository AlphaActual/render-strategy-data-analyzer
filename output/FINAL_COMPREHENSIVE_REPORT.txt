🔄 CROSS-PAGE INSIGHTS
=======================
🏗️ Best Overall Framework: Next.js (94.5% average across all pages)
🔄 Best Overall Strategy: Server-Side Rendering (91.3% average)
📊 Most Consistent Page: About (lowest performance variation)
⚡ Fastest Framework: Next.js dominates in FCP and SI metrics
🎯 Best All-Around Combo: Next.js + SSR/ISR/SSG consistently top-performing

💡 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
=======================
1. 🏆 FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE: Use Next.js with SSR/ISR/SSG
   → Next.js consistently outperforms other frameworks by 5-8%
   
2. 📄 PAGE-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION:
   → About Page: Focus on Next.js + SSG (96.3%)
   → Blog Page: Use Next.js + ISR (96.8%)
   → BlogPost Page: Implement Next.js + SSR (95.8%)

3. 🚀 STRATEGY SELECTION:
   → Avoid CSR for complex pages (BlogPost shows 5% performance drop)
   → SSR/ISR/SSG provide similar benefits, choose based on content needs
   → ISR offers best balance of performance and flexibility

4. 🎯 METRIC-SPECIFIC PRIORITIES:
   → Focus on LCP improvements (consistently lowest scores: 85-88%)
   → TBT optimization needed for Blog page (53.5ms indicates blocking)
   → FCP and SI are well-optimized across all combinations

5. 📈 FRAMEWORK INSIGHTS:
   → Next.js: Superior performance across all metrics and pages
   → Nuxt.js: Good TTI performance, decent alternative
   → SvelteKit: Consistent but lower overall performance

📈 PERFORMANCE PATTERNS
========================
✅ Static rendering strategies (SSG/SSR/ISR) outperform CSR by 3-5%
✅ Next.js shows significant performance advantages (6-8% over competitors)
✅ About page benefits most from SSG due to static content nature
✅ Blog pages perform well with ISR for fresh content balance
✅ Complex pages (BlogPost) benefit from SSR for optimal initial load

⚠️ OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
==============================
1. BlogPost LCP optimization needed (lowest scores: 85%)
2. Blog page TBT reduction required (53.5ms blocking time)
3. Cross-page consistency improvements for SvelteKit
4. CSR performance enhancement for content-heavy pages

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
=========================
PHASE 1 (Immediate - High Impact):
• Migrate to Next.js framework if not already using
• Implement SSR for BlogPost pages
• Implement ISR for Blog pages  
• Use SSG for About/static pages

PHASE 2 (Short-term - Performance Tuning):
• Optimize LCP for all pages (image loading, critical CSS)
• Reduce TBT on Blog pages (code splitting, lazy loading)
• Implement progressive enhancement strategies

PHASE 3 (Long-term - Advanced Optimization):
• A/B test performance improvements
• Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
• Implement advanced caching strategies
• Consider edge computing for global performance
